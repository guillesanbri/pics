<p>In the next posts I will be covering the building process of a Project North Star headset, the open-source augmented reality headset from Leap Motion. I am going to build the simplified optics version (3.1) with mount for the Intel T265 Realsense camera in order to give the headset 6 DOF, although I will be covering this more extensively in the 3D printing post. I have printed the 3D parts at home and I have ordered the mechanical parts, as well as the electronics and optics from <a href="https://www.smart-prototyping.com/AR-VR-MR-XR">smart prototyping</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the project and want to know more, you <strong>really</strong> should join the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/ATPm9Fy">discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is to divide the process in the following posts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3D printed pieces.</li>
  <li>Building process.</li>
  <li>Manual calibration.</li>
  <li>Automatic calibration.</li>
  <li>Software.</li>
</ul>
